                        <h2>Martian Internship </h2>
                        <p>I completed a virtual internship program as a Martian Intern at Persistent Systems from June
                            2023 to August 2023. During this internship, I gained significant skills in Java
                            programming, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Linux, and Database Management Systems
                            (DBMS).</p>
                        <p>I deepened my understanding of complex data structures, honed my problem-solving abilities in
                            DSA, and acquired practical experience in managing and querying databases using DBMS.</p>
                        <p> I worked on practical coding exercises and projects, which allowed me to apply the
                            theoretical knowledge I gained and develop hands-on experience in real-world scenarios.</p>

                        <p>At Semicolon 2023, hosted by Persistent Systems, I developed a project focused on
                            malnutrition prediction and creating a community website.</p>
                        <p>The project aimed to address the issue of malnutrition by predicting potential cases based on
                            various data inputs and providing a platform for community engagement and support. The
                            malnutrition prediction model, developed using Python, analyzed data such as demographics,
                            dietary habits, and health records to identify individuals at risk.</p>

                        <h2>Scholarship </h2>
                        <p>I was selected as a Kiran Scholar for the prestigious Kiran Girls Scholarship Program by the
                            Persistent Foundation, standing out among girls across India. </p>
                        <p>As part of this scholarship, I
                            had the opportunity to attend summer and winter schools throughout my four years of
                            engineering. During these sessions, I received specialized training in Python and Data
                            Structures and Algorithms, which significantly enhanced my technical skills and prepared me
                            for a successful career in software development.</p>

                        <h2>Youth Ambassador, Viral Fission</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a Youth Ambassador at Viral Fission, I leveraged my communication, public speaking, and
                            digital media skills to effectively represent and promote various initiatives. My role
                            involved product marketing, social media marketing, and advertising, which allowed me to
                            engage with a diverse audience and build brand awareness. </p>
                        <p>I also managed and executed a
                            significant project in collaboration with Mahindra Rise, where I coordinated efforts between
                            teams, developed marketing strategies, and ensured the successful promotion and
                            implementation of the projectâ€™s goals. This experience honed my leadership abilities and
                            provided me with valuable insights into project management and corporate collaboration.</p>
