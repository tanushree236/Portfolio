                            <h2>Martian Internship </h2>
                            <p>I completed a virtual internship program as a Martian Intern at Persistent Systems from
                                June
                                2023 to August 2023. During this internship, I gained significant skills in Java
                                programming, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Linux, and Database Management
                                Systems
                                (DBMS).</p>
                            <p>I deepened my understanding of complex data structures, honed my problem-solving
                                abilities in
                                DSA, and acquired practical experience in managing and querying databases using DBMS.
                            </p>
                            <p> I worked on practical coding exercises and projects, which allowed me to apply the
                                theoretical knowledge I gained and develop hands-on experience in real-world scenarios.
